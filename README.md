# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been a web developer for about twenty years, starting in the days when Zeldman released Designing With Web Standards; Eric Meyer was writing books to popularise CSS; and Dan Cederholm was encouraging front-end "Web Standard Solutions". XHTML was a thing, Inspector/Firebug were not.

I've seen a lot, and a huge portion of the skills and knowledge from those days carry over to today. If you want to make an accessible, fast, high quality website - you need to know these core things.

## Tools of choice

Tools are not skills, but choosing the right tool for the right job certainly is. I currently do not build SPA's, and so I do not much use REACT / Vue / Angular etc.

* CMS of choice: Craft CMS - brilliant, flexible, excellent community, headless or not.
* Text editor of choice: VSCode and Vim.

## More to come

I'll fill this out properly at some point...
